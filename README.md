## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- To get a jumpstart at learning HTML, Git, CSS, and JS
- To learn how to start coding and learning the fundamentals 
- Having something to come back to and having a website for notes
- I learned how to use git bash and all the git commands. I learned how to add html to a basic website using ul and li. also how to identify the parts of code such as header footers and other sections of the code.

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
